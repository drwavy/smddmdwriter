# SMDDMDWRITER

**Social Media Data Download Metadata Writer**\
*Metadata is not Metaâ€™s data!*

## Overview

SMDDMDWRITER makes it easy to organize and rewrite metadata back into your social media data exports. 
After your export is analyzed, it's neatly formatted and organized in a csv for you to make any edits you want. 
Your post captions, sender usernames, geolocation data, tagged users, date uploaded, mismanaged files, 
all processed and cleaned into two csv files. Utilizing kDMItems and Quicktime tags, SMDDMDWRTIER prepares media for 
Apple Photos and displaying accurate metadata in macOS Finder.

### Features
- Processes Instagram data exports in JSON and HTML formats.
- Organizes & formats metadata into clean CSV files for editing.
- Supports geolocation, captions, usernames, and tagging.
- Prepares media for Apple Photos, macOS Finder, and UNIX filesystem indexing.
